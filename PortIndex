If you wanted to take advantage of Unicode in your application and support Windows 95/98 at the same time, your only option was to deploy two executables, one for NT and one for 9X. Fortunately, this changed in 2001 when MS (finally!) released MSLU runtime that allows Unicode applications to run under Windows 9X. Less fortunately, this solution requires that you use a special statically linked import library that decides at runtime whether to load symbols from system libraries like kernel32.dll or user32.dll (in case of Windows NT) or from unicows.dll (which provides Unicode emulation layer under 9X). This import library is only available for Microsoft Visual C++ and is only part of the new Platform SDK, which is rather huge package. libunicows contains independent implementation of the import library. For a free runtime DLL, take a look at http://opencow.sourceforge.net/} categories {cross devel} version 1.1.1 revision 0
